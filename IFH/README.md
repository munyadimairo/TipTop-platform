# Impacted Fetal Head (IFH) research question
This contains generic **Stata** programs used to calculate operating charateristics for an adaptive design allowing for early stopping for futility at specified interim analyses for a trial with binary co-primary outcomes. No efficacy early stopping is allowed. The calculation of operating characteristics is done through simulation. A reduction in the event rate is assumed to be a good outcome for both co-primary outcomes. As informed by clinical advice in this context,:
- a decision to stop early is triggered when the treatment shows futility on both co-primary outcomes
- evidence for efficacy is claimed at the end if superiority is shown on both co-primary outcomes.
