# Cord clamping research question
Contains **R** code files that were used to explore the operating characteristics of an adaptive design proposed to address the cord clamping research question within the proposed [TipTop platform](https://app.dimensions.ai/details/grant/grant.13559526). The design allows for a non-binding futility early stopping. No early stopping for efficacy is allowed. Designs allowing for 1 and 2 interim analyses are explored.
